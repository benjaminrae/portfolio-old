        This project was an extra part of the ISDI Coders precourse. The
        objective was to create a Connect 4 style game. I used CSS grid for the
        game grid but flexbox for the rest. The main challenge was creating
        logic that could be reused if the grid was resized. For horizontal and
        vertical wins it was easy. One a piece is placed, the row/column is
        checked for at least 4 consecutive counters from the same player. The
        diagonals were more difficult since the columns and rows don't stay
        constant. In the end, I create a starting point by looking for the
        bottom of the diagonal. Then from there checked the full diagonal for at
        least 4 consecutive counters by the same player.
